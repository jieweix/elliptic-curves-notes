Lecture notes for MATH70064 Elliptic Curves at Imperial College London, 2024/25.

The notes are finished but not necessarily free from errors.

The module comprises reminders for p-adic numbers and Bézout's theorem, and then goes on to prove the Hasse–Minkowski theorem and the Mordell–Weil theorem, with a look into latest studies and the future research of elliptic curves at the end.
